## Overview

This project utilizes an API endpoint to dynamically fetch and display the population data of the United States of America from 2013 to 2021. The data is presented in a clean and organized table format on a webpage.

## Usage

If the response status code from the API endpoint is 200, indicating a successful data retrieval, the table displaying the population data is rendered on the webpage. In case of any other status code, a message is displayed indicating that the data is not available.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the webpage is simple and intuitive. It begins with a title "US Population Data," followed by a visually appealing screenshot showcasing the populated table.

### Table Structure

Below the title, a table is created to present the population data. Using a loop, the information retrieved from the API is inserted into the table cells, ensuring a chronological order for easier readability.
